Daisy Bell Gamer Mode oFF mAIN

GO DO THE JAM!!!!

Daisy, Daisy
Give me your answer do
I'm half crazy
All for the gamer of you
It won't be a stylish gaming
I LIKE INDIGO IT IS MY FAVOURITE COLORATION DE LAS CARTAS.
I can't afford a GTXR90
But you'll look sweet
Upon the seat
Of a gaming chair built for two

Was the first excerpt to be sang by the computer.
Adapted for gamers, like Veronica. us IFF NAU, NM MAIN.

UP UP WHAT'S SLAM!!!!

PC P ALRI!!!!
